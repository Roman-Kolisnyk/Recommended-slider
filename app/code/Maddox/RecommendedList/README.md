The Maddox\RecommendedList module adds the slick slider with recommended products to cart or checkout pages and works with the custom endpoint that is implemented in the WeatherType module.

In the admin panel you'll see the new Slider configuration. There you can interact with the slider options.
The module can find customers' locations by their IP address if you don't have information about their addresses. It works with help of the ip-api.com service.

The module has its own log file - /var/log/recommendedList.log
